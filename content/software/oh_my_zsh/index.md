### update

Manual Updates
```bash
omz update
```

Getting Updates:
By default, you will be prompted to check for updates every ***2*** weeks.\
You can choose other update modes by adding a line to your ***~/.zshrc*** file, before **Oh My Zsh** is loaded:

```properties
# Uncomment one of the following lines to change the auto-update behavior
# zstyle ':omz:update' mode disabled  # disable automatic updates
# zstyle ':omz:update' mode auto      # update automatically without asking
zstyle ':omz:update' mode reminder  # just remind me to update when it's time

# Uncomment the following line to change how often to auto-update (in days).
zstyle ':omz:update' frequency 13  # This will check for updates every 13 days
# zstyle ':omz:update' frequency 0   # This will check for updates every time you open the terminal (not recommended)

# Updates verbosity
# You can also limit the update verbosity with the following settings:
zstyle ':omz:update' verbose default  # default update prompt
# zstyle ':omz:update' verbose minimal  # only few lines
# zstyle ':omz:update' verbose silent  # only errors
```

### config

config your ***~/.zshrc*** file

```properties
# Set name of the theme to load --- if set to "random", it will
# load a random theme each time oh-my-zsh is loaded, in which case,
# to know which specific one was loaded, run: echo $RANDOM_THEME
# See https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes
#ZSH_THEME="darkblood"
ZSH_THEME="linuxonly"
#ZSH_THEME="frisk"
#ZSH_THEME="random"

# Set list of themes to pick from when loading at random
# Setting this variable when ZSH_THEME=random will cause zsh to load
# a theme from this variable instead of looking in $ZSH/themes/
# If set to an empty array, this variable will have no effect.
#ZSH_THEME_RANDOM_CANDIDATES=("linuxonly" "frisk" "darkblood")

# Which plugins would you like to load?
# Standard plugins can be found in $ZSH/plugins/
# Custom plugins may be added to $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.
plugins=(git docker-compose kubectl)
